# How to get a discord ID

On discord, the various elements (user, salon, server, message, etc.) all have their own id, which enables the api to identify them.

To retrieve your item's ID, simply :
- Open Settings and go to the "Advanced" tab, itself in "APP SETTINGS".
- Make sure "Developer Mode" is activated
- Then right-click on your element (a user for example) and select "Copy {the name of your element} ID".
